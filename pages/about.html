                started as a casual hobby over 4 years ago in 2020 while I was
                studying now grown into a full-blown business that reaches much
                of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has
                been featured on The Kitchn.

            <p class="about-last-text">
              In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly)
              healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual,
              every day life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in
              on the blog. My goal is to inspire you with food that is both
              approachable AND exciting, whether you’re cooking for yourself,
              your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so
              excited about these recipes.
              <br />
              <br />
              On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food that you’re
              making. It will make my day if you tag our website in your
              Instagram photos and stories! We love to shout out our favorites
              on Fridays with our Reader Awards on Instagram Stories.

              My team is my family. All four of us are sisters from the same
              family. Also, they were with me every moment to make this a
              success.

              Family bonds are the emotional connections that tie family members together, providing a sense of belonging, support, and love. These bonds are often nurtured through shared experiences, traditions, and open communication. They create a foundation of trust and security, allowing individuals to feel safe expressing their thoughts and feelings. Strong family bonds can help navigate life's challenges, fostering resilience and emotional well-being. Whether through quality time spent together, acts of kindness, or simply being present, these connections enrich our lives and contribute to a sense of community that lasts beyond individual experiences.
